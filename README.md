The Impact of Earnings Report on Stock Price in C++

This project is intended to explore the impact of earning surprise on stock price. 
Stocks downloaded via libcurl from Yahoo Finance, are divided into three groups,
‘Miss’, ‘Meet’ and ‘Beat’ basing on the percentage difference between estimated EPS and actual EPS. 
CAAR (Cumulative Average Abnormal Return) of each group is introduced to compare the performance. 
The plot of CAAR is graphed by ExcelDriver.
